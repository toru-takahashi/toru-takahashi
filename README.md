## Approach to career

I want to help people who work with data to use it to its fullest potential.
I feel it is a shame that talented people in the world are not able to make the most of good services due to a slight lack of knowledge in order to create a better society. I am considering a career focusing on work that fills this knowledge gap.
I believe that this problem can be achieved not only through support, but also through various roles such as solution architect and developer relations, so I would like to work on a wide range of initiatives, not limited to a specific job title.

I personally like and am good at working as an Indivual Contributor (IC).
On the other hand, I am not good at management skills, such as developing team members and solving problems. However, I can be flexible in both IC and management depending on the business situation.

## Skills
### Programming languages, frameworks, middleware, hardware, services
- Ruby, Python, Java, Javascript, Go, etc.
- AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
- Ubuntu, CentOS, etc
- Zendesk, Confluence, Github, Salesforce, etc
- fluentd, digdag, embulk, etc

I can do some code reading and script writing for debugging and bug fixing.
For example, Treasure Data's API library is available in a variety of languages, including mobile, browser, and other languages, so it is possible to read the code, identify defects, and make simple fixes in any language. On the other hand, I do not have much experience in full-scratch, large-scale system development from scratch. For example, I do not like to create a distributed DB from scratch, but I am good at combining existing IaaS/SaaS such as AWS to create a system.

Furthermore, I always try to catch up with data analysis/ETL/BI services, tools, and OSS that are in the same area as Treasure Data, and I am familiar with their usage and service characteristics.

### Others
- He has been using an agile development method for SaaS service development, especially in the startup phase.
- He is also knowledgeable about CI/CD, canary release, blue-green deployment method, and other common methods of how to safely release to customer environments.
- At Treasure Data, He created a Release Safety Advisor process where the support and R&D teams evaluate releases to ensure that they are released with customer conditions and stability in mind, and I was responsible for contributing to the process.
